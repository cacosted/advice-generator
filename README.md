## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript
- Sass
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Node

### What I learned

I installed Sass preprocessor to handle styling, was really interesting to set it up with node:

```js
  //Installed as a developer dependency and without caret(Ë†)
  npm install sass -ED
```

In this project a learn how works `@use` to modularize the styling files:
```css
  @use 'card' as card

  /* Here is inserted the styles from card.sass */
  card
```

### Useful resources

- [Sass documentation](https://sass-lang.com/) - The official documentation helped me setup `sass` with `npm`.
- [Sass modules](https://css-tricks.com/introducing-sass-modules/) - This was a great article to understand better `@use` and how to use it to modularize the styles.
